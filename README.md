# Base Android Project Templete

##Installation
- Clone this repository to the following directory depending on your machine:

*MacOS*
```
/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities/
```

*Windows*
```
C:/Users/<<username>>/AppData/Local/Android/android-studio/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities/
```

## Important Notes!
This template is added as an Activity-template for Android Studio. This means that it is also possible integrating this template from New -> Activity menu again. **Do not execute this template more than once on one project. Since this template will explicitly override some files (e.g. build.gradle, AndroidManifest.xml) without confirmation.**
